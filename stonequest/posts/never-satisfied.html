                    <p>
                        I prototyped an interface next that I would end up using for over a year.
                        It had everything a basic roguelike needed: an inventory, a character sheet
                        and a world log history to keep track of the events taking place around the
                        player.
                    </p>
                    <a href="../img/progress/2.png" target="_blank">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/progress/2.png" alt="Java interface">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">The earliest real interface for StoneQuest</span>
                    <p>
                        The red <code><span class="text-danger">@</span></code> represents the player character,
                        the purple <code><span style="color: purple">#</span></code> represents walkable tiles
                        (note the player has moved far out of bounds in this screenshot...), green 
                        <code><span class="text-success">|</span></code> and <code><span class="text-success">-</span></code>
                        represent walls and the green
                        <code><span class="text-success">%</span></code> was a profoundly simple enemy
                        character. The text box at the bottom left reports events happening around the player 
                        in the world, the box to the right of that is the player's character sheet and the taller
                        box on the far right is the player's inventory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For over a month, I doodled in notebooks and pseudocoded algorithms to
                        randomly generate my levels, enemies and items. I spent so much more time
                        on the fundamental game design than actually designing the game during
                        this period. When I decided to start implementing some things, I also 
                        started the project over from scratch. Dozens of hours later, I
                        found myself with this:
                    </p>
                    <a href="../img/progress/4.png" target="_blank">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/progress/4.png" alt="Java interface">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">The earliest fully-functional interface for StoneQuest</span>
                    <p>
                        I still find it simple and elegant. It served its purpose well and was very 
                        easy to create. Near the end of this iteration, I even had color themes that
                        the player could change at will. But I wanted more still from StoneQuest. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Graphics</h2>
                    <p>
                        So, I replaced the ASCII tile system with simple artwork that I drew.
                    </p>
                    <a href="../img/progress/8.png" target="_blank">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/progress/8.png" alt="Introduction of graphics">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">StoneQuest starts using Canvas and a double buffer rasterizer</span>
                    <p>
                        It is about this time when I decided on the name for my game, StoneQuest. I also added
                        a nifty minimap in the top right. I found it necessary to put more effort on the story
                        before I could continue with the art style, skills, setting, etc. (Read more about
                        the story <a href="story-time.html">here</a>.)
                    </p>
                    <h2>Still Not Satisfied</h2>
                    <p>
                        It still was not right. I felt the UI no longer matched the introduction of 
                        graphics.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I liked this one a lot. Still like it, in fact. But it was not very user-friendly. 
                        It was annoying to use, even.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So I spent nearly the entire summer in 2013 drawing and detailing every window that I would want
                        to have in the final game: inventory, character, item upgrade, a journal, item
                        salvaging and alchemy. I spent the remainder of the summer overhauling the internal
                        system as well. I improved the performance of the game during the following semester by
                        significant amounts, which allowed me to create larger maps. I also increased the size of the
                        individual tiles to expose more detail.
                    </p>
                        
                    <a href="../img/progress/11.png" target="_blank">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">And now, something a bit more Diablo 3</span>
                    
                    <p>
                        The more I worked in the game engine that I created in Java, the more I realized
                        I was reinventing the wheel. I wrote my own event handler and rasterizer
                        which took a long time and still wasn't perfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This prompted me to investigate alternatives. I spent some time working in a Java
                        library called <a href="http://slick.ninjacave.com">Slick2D</a> before moving 
                        on to <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com">libGDX</a>. But it didn't feel right.
                        It was not as enjoyable to work in as was working in the game engine I wrote from
                        scratch (mostly).
                    </p>
