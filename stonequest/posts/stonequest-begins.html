                    <h2>Why It Began</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since before I was given my first computer, I was fascinated by them. I loved how the circuitry looked and imagined them
                        as miniature towns, with buildings and roads. When I got my first computer, running Windows 95, I
                        spent hours in command prompt trying to make it do simple thing because it made me feel like I was
                        really controlling the computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, I fell in love with computer games. The first computer game I can remember playing, apart from Solitaire, Minesweeper
                        and Ski, was this marble puzzle game at my uncle's house. From there, I began playing all kinds of
                        games, always trying new genres of games, experimental games, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I began my college education, I worked more and more on personal projects - small things that I found fun to program.
                        In December 2011, I decided to create a game, a very simple roguelike, with ASCII graphics and only
                        keyboard input. I started in C using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">Ncurses</a>                        library. To speed up production and focus solely on game design, I abandoned the C project and began
                        again in Java, using the Swing library since I was very familiar with both at this point.
                    </p>

                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">The earliest screenshot of StoneQuest I have. Written in Java using the Swing framework.</span>
                    <h2>Iterative Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        From this point on, in early 2012, I began a series of constant 
                        tweaking and perfecting. Every few months, I would launch the
                        game and realize how this or that could be improved, and I would
                        spend as much time as necessary to ensure it was perfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UI got the most obvious overhaul over the years, but internally,
                        I spent countless hours fighting Java and Swing (and eventually Canvas)
                        to get it to do what I wanted it to do. I wrote a rasterizer for images
                        and fonts, a custom event handler that sat on top of Swing's for key
                        and mouse input and of course the game loop and object interactivity and
                        collision-detection.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I was never satisfied with anything for too long. Arguably, this was a flaw
                        in the internal management for the game development - it prevented a game
                        that could have been released and put aside years ago. Honestly, the game
                        was in a shippable state in the summer of 2012. But with as much time as I had
                        spent designing, programming and thinking about StoneQuest, I couldn't leave
                        it at that. I decided it would be the culmination of my near-decade's experience
                        of programming and roughly 17 years of games experience; it would be
                        my dream.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Story Time</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I wasn't writing working directly on programming the game, I was
                        outside thinking of the story I wanted StoneQuest to have. I'll cover
                        the entire story (so far) in another blog post, <a href="story-time.html">here</a>.
