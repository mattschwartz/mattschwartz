        <p>I consider Worlds Between to be the beginning of the actualization of my desire to write and design my own game which started in December of 2011, over winter break. My life was about to move in an unpredictable direction when I returned to university a few weeks later, but until then all I wanted to do was expand my skills as a programmer.</p>

        <p>I had just learned about <a className="fancy-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a> and completed a semester of advanced networking in C, so naturally I began looking into <a className="fancy-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a>. It was quickly abandoned because I wanted to spend more of the time I had writing the game before the break ended. I went with what I knew at the time: <a className="fancy-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)">Java Swing</a>. From this point on, I began a series of constant tweaking and perfecting. After hundreds of times starting up the game in development, I would realize how this or that could be improved and would spend as much time as necessary to ensure it was perfect before moving on.</p>

        <p>The UI got the most obvious overhaul over the years, as you will see below, but internally I spent countless hours fighting Swing and eventually Canvas to do what I wanted it to do. I wrote a custom rasterizer for images and fonts; a custom event-handling loop that sat on top of Swing's for key and mouse input; and of course the game loop itself, object interactivity, and collision detection. I was never satisfied with anything for too long. It would be fair to critique me for that. The UI was usable and the fundamental game mechanics were all there. It could have been called finished in the summer of 2012.</p>

        <p>But I realized as soon as I gave it a name why I was obsessing over it like I had been at that point: I had a story to tell and a promise to keep. This is still my very first game. And this will be the first story I ever tell. </p>


        <p>
            While working on StoneQuest, I developed some story points and tropes that I wanted to include in the final game. They were formless and more feeling than thought but my story was in there waiting for me when I was ready.
        </p>

        <p>
            StoneQuest was to be set in the typical fantasy world, 1100s or 1200s maybe. The player would begin at the edge of a small town that sat in the shadow of a looming mountain nearby. In standard roguelike fashion, the player would descend into that mountain and find tougher and tougher enemies as she delved deeper. I had planned on theming sections of the underground with the story, which would tell itself as the player went lower and lower. At some point, she would find the dead civilization of the dwarves: the religious icons they worshipped and the gods that benefited them and punished them; the machines of the underground that powered the world; and finally...

        <p>
            Well, I hadn't really planned that part out. It never found its form in the context of StoneQuest because StoneQuest wasn't the story I needed to tell. But I sat on it and years later, it found me through <strong>Worlds Between Blood</strong>.
