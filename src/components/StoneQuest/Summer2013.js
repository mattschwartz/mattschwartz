            The UI depicted above was horrible to use as a player. It was tiny and hard to read at best and completely unintuitive at worst. I kept tweaking the UI more and more. I spent much of the summer sitting down and drawing. I increased the tile size since it was too small before. I upgraded the interface with a focus on readability, familiarity, and usability. I wrote transient UI elements like tips and implemented much more interactive interface elements.

            Without realizing it, I had begun to tie the development of StoneQuest to big moments in my personal life. I can still see where I was in my life through these screenshots. So it's no wonder to me that seeing this screenshot now makes me immeasurably sad.

            Here is the last screenshot I have to offer for StoneQuest as it existed for almost a year using Java's Canvas library:

            It was at this point I realized the code base was doomed. The input handling was a complete mess and the UI elements were just as bad internally. Scene transitions were non-existent and making them would have necessitated a major rework. I spent a few weeks trying to improve it and left it in an irrevocable state. I did not use any sort of source control before this point and have not bothered to salvage it. I don't have any way to know an exact date, but the last image I have is dated May 11, 2013.

            For all meaningful implications, this is where and when StoneQuest died.
