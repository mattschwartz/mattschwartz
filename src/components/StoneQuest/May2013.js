            From July 2012 until May 2013, I dedicated several hundred hours working on the game. It was sometime between January and March where I plucked the name StoneQuest out of the air, which was intended to be a working title. And once I gave it a name, it became very real to me and for the first time, I spent more time making a game  than I did playing them. And the game was iterated on constantly. Over spring break, I went home again and implemented 2D graphics. It was surprisingly easy, but the performance was trash. Below is the first screenshot I have of these (terribly over-saturated) graphics:

            It's painful to look at now and I would have said that then, too. The next things I added were: a minimap; shadow-casting; monsters to fight; interactable objects like chests; loot you could pick up, drop and equip; mouse support; double-buffered rendering to fix the performance issues; a sound engine; and, of course, a revamped UI. Features came and went so quickly and I felt truly inspired passion. This is the most complete StoneQuest had ever been and, regrettably, ever will be:
