                The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which all life is presumed extinct. 
                The unnamed protagonist, controlled by the player awakens in a city devastated by an
                unknown disaster and in order to find out what happened and who he is, he must uncover
                the truth.

            <p>
                <u>After</u> was created by a group of five students, including myself, through UT's GAMMA game design program.
                The course was designed to be student-driven, allowing teams to design their own games with minimal constraints
                and guidance on the part of the instructors. My role in <u>After</u> was one of the two programmers and lead
                programmer for mobile direction for the game. More specifically, I:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Designed the puzzle game loop</b>
                        <br> I programmed a set of Unity prefabs that allowed new puzzles to be set up quickly by defining how each
                        individual piece was involved with other parts of the level
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Designed a simple sound manager</b>
                        <br> I worked with our sound engineer, Rob Luckfield, to develop a simple interface for adding and tweaking
                        sounds in the game
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Designed and implemented the mobile interface</b>
                        <br> The instructors' gave additional credit for teams who implemented their game for mobile platforms as
                        well. Ours was the only team to have done this. I developed the mobile interface, which was simply drag-to-move
                        and touch-to-jump
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Helped with the artwork</b>
                        <br> I drew placeholder art and ended up finishing some first-pass artwork by our artist. The title scene
                        artwork (also featured as the banner at the top of this page) was drawn by me
                    </li>
